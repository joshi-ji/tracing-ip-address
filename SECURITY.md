# Security and Responsible Use

- **Scope:** Detect potential anonymity networks (VPN/Proxy/Tor/Hosting) using provider data and heuristics. No promise of revealing a “real IP behind” a VPN/proxy.
- **Legal/Ethical:** Analyze IPs only where permitted by law and policy. Do not attempt unlawful tracing or interception.
- **Reporting:** Disclose vulnerabilities responsibly via a private channel prior to public disclosure.
- **Deployment:** Use HTTPS, manage secrets securely, and configure trusted proxy settings appropriately if behind Nginx/Traefik.
