# Limitations

- Revealing a user’s “real IP behind” a VPN/proxy is generally not feasible without provider cooperation or endpoint instrumentation; this project does not implement that feature.
- Third-party data can misclassify some residential IPs; confidence reflects uncertainty with evidence.
- Tor exit nodes rotate frequently; refresh lists periodically for accuracy.
